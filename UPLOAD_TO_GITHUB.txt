INSTRUCTIONS TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB
=================================

After creating a new repository on GitHub, run these commands:

1. Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
   
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sfc-diagram-generator.git

2. Rename the branch to main (GitHub's default):
   
   git branch -M main

3. Push your code to GitHub:
   
   git push -u origin main

That's it! Your code will be uploaded to GitHub.

ALTERNATIVE: If you prefer SSH instead of HTTPS, use:
   
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/sfc-diagram-generator.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
